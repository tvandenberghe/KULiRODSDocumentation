<h1>Using WinSCP to access iRODS {#winscp_access_irods.rst}</h1>
<p>Another tool to upload/download data to/from iRODS through a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) is WinSCP (Windows Secure Copy). WinSCP is an open
source free (SFTP client, FTP client, WebDAV client, S3 client and SCP
client) for Windows. Its main function is file transfer between a local
and a remote computer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write the password down that you get at
<a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be/">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be/</a>. Do not enter the password in the
Password text box. As it is quite long, it will be truncated by
WinSCP and it is only valid for 4 hours anyway.</li>
</ul>

Note
:::</p>
<p>Since the password you obtained is temporary, you need to get a new one
every time your password has expired.
:::</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time you make the connection, you will be prompted for the
password and asked to 'Continue connecting and add host key to the
cache'; select 'Yes'.</li>
<li>You can choose/set your remote directory for ease of use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upload/Download Data to/from iRODS using WinSCP</h2>
<ul>
<li>On the WinSCP screen, the right pane shows our connection to iRODS,
and the left pane shows our local directories.</li>
<li>To upload data from local to iRODS, simply drag a file or a folder
on the left pane and drop it in the place we want on the right pane.</li>
<li>To upload data from iRODS to our local directory, we drag data
object(s) or collection(s) from the right pane and drop them in the
place we want on the left pane.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="winscp/winscp3.png" alt="image"></p>
<ul>
<li>We can use WinSCP on both local and iRODS to create/delete/rename a
file or folder.</li>
<li>It is also possible to edit a file with a GUI editor to easily
change content. This is not possible with iCommands.</li>
</ul>

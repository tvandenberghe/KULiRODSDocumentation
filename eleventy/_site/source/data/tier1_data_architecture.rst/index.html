<h1>Tier-1 Data Platform Architecture {#tier1_data_architecture}</h1>
<p>The VSC Tier-1 Data component is based on the open source software
iRODS. The following image shows the high level archirecture of the
platform.</p>
<p><img src="architecture/general_overview.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>The current deployment is based in a unique iRODS zone
(&quot;kuleuven_tier1_pilot&quot;) with a single iCAT database configured on High
Availability. There are three distributed storage resources: 2 POSIX
based systems and 1 Ceph Object Storage system).</p>
<p>A user can access iRODS from a local computer and/or the VSC Tier-1 and
Tier-2 systems using different types of user clients. At this moment
there are available: programming clients such as iCommands and a Python
client; web applications such as MetaLnx and (soon) the KU Leuven Data
Portal; and various clients implementing WebDAV.</p>
<p>iCommands is an utility that gives users a command-line interface to
operate on data in iRODS. PRC is a Python Client API to establish a
secure connection to iRODS and to be able to interoperate with iRODS
from python programs.</p>
<p>With the aid of the WebDAV protocol, Drag and Drop Access to iRODS is
ensured by means of some apps/tools (e.g. WebDAV mapping, Cyberduck and
WinSCP) that enable data transfer.</p>

<h1>Workflow automation {#workflow_automation.rst}</h1>
<p>iRODS provides a Rule System to automate data management tasks. Each
organisation or project has its own policies and needs with regards to
file housekeeping and metadata extraction. Examples of file operations
are making regular backups, checking file integrity, cleaning up
permissions, emptying the trash,... Metadata can be extracted from data
files or accompanying text files to be stored to the iCAT catalog. This
frees human users of having to apply repetitive actions, and ensures
policies are applied consistently and without error.</p>
<p>This is made possible by the Rule Engine Plugin Framework (REPF), which
executes the rules and keeps track of the execution state of all active
rules (as rules can be immediate, have a delay or a condition). The
framework keeps track of both User-level rules and System-level rules.</p>
<p>User-level rules are stored locally and manually invoked by any user
using the <code>irule</code> command, which runs it in the iRODS server. They are
meant for personal or group use (if the user is part of that group) and
are typically simple 'one-shot' workflow operations. System-defined
rules are stored server-side by an iRODS developer or administrator and
automatically invoked by the Rule Engine when a certain condition is
met. This condition is called an 'event' or more formally a Policy
Enforcement Point (PEP). They are meant for consistent data management
of a whole zone or for complex group/project data management tasks.</p>
<p>Rules can be invoked in three ways: by directly calling the <code>irule</code>
command on a rule file (only for User-level rules); by reaching a Policy
Enforcement Point, triggering a System-level rule; or periodically via
Delay rules (both for User-level and System-level rules).
Resource-heavy, time-intensive processes are best executed as a
system-level delay rules.</p>
<p>The Python iRODS Client (PRC) is executed client-side, making it
somewhat less efficient than iRODS rule execution. Although both offer
overlapping functionality, the delay mechanism used by iRODS rules is
more graceful and these rules get stored centrally in the REPF. It is
also possible to invoke a rule via the PRC.</p>
<p>This article focuses only on User-level rules. If you have more complex
data processing pipelines, the Tier-1 Data Team (FOZ-RDM) at KU Leuven
can create System-level rules for you. Please contact us at
<a href="mailto:data@vscentrum.be">data@vscentrum.be</a>.</p>
<h2>Rule syntax</h2>
<p>Rules can be written in Python, C++ or the iRODS Rule language. However,
normal users can (for the time being) only execute rules written in the
iRODS Rule language (either User-level or System-level rules). The iRODS
Rule language is a domain specific scripting language composed of simple
building blocks. It uses curly brackets, # for comments, variable names
start with '*' and strings are enclosed by ' or &quot;. The
documentation for the language can be found here:
<a href="https://docs.irods.org/4.2.10/plugins/irods_rule_language/">https://docs.irods.org/4.2.10/plugins/irods_rule_language/</a>.</p>
<pre><code>rulename{             # rulename, like 'extractMetaDataRule', followed by the body block
    on(condition){    # condition is optional
        delay(delay){ # delay is optional
            list of actions
        }
    }                 # condition is optional
}

input INPUT           # input is optional
output OUTPUT
</code></pre>
<p>A rulefile can contain more than one rulename blocks, although only the
first one gets executed. The second one can get called by the first one
in the list of actions and its output can be saved as a variable for the
caller. Some of the elements are optional. A rule without condition or
delay gets executed immediately, once. 'Input' variables are optional
(or can be set to null) and can be used to store a global variable for
all rules inside the rulefile or prompt for user input.</p>
<p>It is not illegal syntax to use a condition in a user-level rule, but
the conditions can't be used to track system events similar to a what a
PEP does.</p>
<h2>Executing rules</h2>
<p>This rule prints 'Hello World' to the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>helloWorldRule{
    writeLine('stdout', 'Hello World!');
}

output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p><code>output ruleExecOut</code> indicates that this rule is executable. Save this
code in a file called myFirstRule.r and call it by issuing:</p>
<pre><code>$ irule -F myFirstRule.r
</code></pre>
<p>As said, we can call rules like this, just as if they would be
functions:</p>
<pre><code>firstRule{
    writeLine('stdout', 'This is my first rule');
    secondRule()
}

secondRule{
    writeLine('stdout', 'This is my second rule');
}

output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<h2>Variables and user input</h2>
<p>Variables can be assigned to in the body block or in an input variable.
You can concatenate string variables with the '++' operator.</p>
<pre><code>advancedHelloWorldRule{
    #you can define a variable here
    *var1=&quot;Hello &quot;;
    writeLine('stdout', *var1 ++ *var2);
}

#you can also define a variable here
input *var2=&quot;World&quot;
output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p>We can also prompt the user for input by assigning a variable to '$',
with an optional default value. In the next example, the <code>greeting1</code>
variable can be either set to what the user types or kept at its default
value 'Hello' by hitting enter. When typing your prompted value, it
should be enclosed with single or double quotes. Also note that
variables are expanded in quoted strings.</p>
<pre><code>evenMoreAdvancedHelloWorldRule{
    writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;,&quot;User says '*greeting1 *greeting2'&quot;)
}
input *greeting1 = $'Hello', *greeting2 = $'World'
output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p>There are also session state variables, for instance to retrieve the
active user:</p>
<pre><code>veryAdvancedHelloWorldRule{
    writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;,&quot;$userNameClient says '*greeting1 *greeting2'&quot;)
}
input *greeting1 = $'Hello', *greeting2 = $'World'
output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p>Another useful session state variable for User-level rules is
<code>$rodsZoneClient</code> for the zone name. There are other session variables
(like <code>$collName</code>, <code>$objPath</code>, <code>$dataType</code>, <code>$dataSize</code>, <code>$chksum</code>,...)
but these are only useful for System-level rules as they are out of
scope in a User-level rule.</p>
<h2>Querying iRODS</h2>
<p>Just like in the iquest iCommand and with the PRC we can query iCAT and
retrieve matching fields for entities (data objects or collections).
These fields are called 'Persistent State Information'. Rules can also
access 'Session state information', such as the <code>$userNameClient</code>
variable above. To see which persistent fields are available, use
<code>iquest attrs</code>.</p>
<p>The following rule prints all data objects whose logical path contains
the word 'test'. Note that COLL_NAME is the whole path with the
collection name at the end:</p>
<pre><code>queryRule{
    foreach(*i in SELECT COLL_NAME, DATA_NAME WHERE COLL_NAME like '%test%'){
        *coll = *i.COLL_NAME;
        *data = *i.DATA_NAME;
        writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;, &quot;*coll/*data&quot;);
    }
    writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;, &quot;listing done&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Microservices and custom functions</h2>
<p>iRODS already provides a whole library of functions to interact with it
via the Rule system, called microservices. Microservices are written in
C within the iRODS source code. These can be called in the rule body as
any other action.</p>
<p>You can find an overview of all available microservices in the <a href="https://docs.irods.org/4.2.8/">iRODS
documentation</a> under the tab
<a href="https://docs.irods.org/4.2.8/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>. These pages also
contain their function arguments and types.</p>
<p>There are microservices for rule management, manipulating data objects,
collections and their metadata, managing the iCAT database,... It also
includes basic functions like email (<code>msiSendStdoutAsEmail</code>), string and
key-value manipulation. The following example creates a new collection:</p>
<pre><code>createCollRule {
        *path=&quot;/$rodsZoneClient/home/$userNameClient/newCollection&quot;;
        msiCollCreate(*path, 0, *Status);
        writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;, &quot;Collection *path created&quot;);

} 
output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p>You can of course also save data objects from a local disk with the
<code>msiDataObjPut</code> microservice. As an input variable you should use the
absolute path of a file. The second argument for <code>msiDataObjPut</code> is the
iRODS resource where you want to save the file. A resource, or storage
resource, is a software/hardware system that stores digital data. You
can identify the available resources with the <code>ilsresc</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>createDORule {
        *path=&quot;/$rodsZoneClient/home/$userNameClient/newCollection&quot;
        *destName=&quot;test.txt&quot;
        writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;, &quot;Saving file *path/*destName ...&quot;)
        msiDataObjPut(&quot;*path/*destName&quot;,&quot;default&quot;,&quot;localPath=*file++++forceFlag=&quot;,*Status)
        writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;, &quot;File *path/*file created&quot;)
}

input *file=&quot;/home/x/y/z/test.txt&quot;
output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p>In your rulefile, you can define functions to contain oft-used
functionality. Functions can be thought of as microservices written in
the rule language and are called similarly. It's also possible to pass
variables to a function, and let it return its result.</p>
<pre><code>functionRule {
    *c = sq(5)
    writeLine('stdout',*c)
}

sq(*a){
        *b=*a * *a
        *b
}

input null
output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<h2>Delayed execution rules</h2>
<p>A rule action can be executed (as a System-level rule or with <code>irule</code>)
at a certain point in the future by delaying it or scheduling it at a
certain time. To express this, a timing syntax based on XML is provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ET: Absolute time when something should be performed, for instance
at 8:00 PM: &lt;ET&gt;20:00&lt;/ET&gt;.</li>
<li>PLUSET: Delay execution for a certain amount of time from now, for
instance &lt;PLUSET&gt;10s&lt;/PLUSET&gt; or &lt;PLUSET&gt;1m&lt;/PLUSET&gt;.</li>
<li>EF: Perform execution every n time units, for a certain amount of
time. The default is forever. For instance, &lt;EF&gt;1d&lt;/EF&gt; for
daily.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full syntax is provided
<a href="https://docs.irods.org/4.2.10/plugins/pluggable_rule_engine/#examples">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>backupRule{
        delay(&quot;&lt;ET&gt;00:00&lt;/ET&gt;&lt;PLUSET&gt;1d&lt;/PLUSET&gt;&quot;){
            msiTarFileCreate(*file,*coll,*resource,*flag);
            writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;,&quot;Created tar file *file for collection *coll on resource *resc&quot;);
        }
}
input *file=&quot;/$rodsZoneClient/home/$userNameClient/backup_newCollection.tar&quot;, *coll=&quot;/$rodsZoneClient/home/$userNameClient/newCollection&quot;, *resource=&quot;default&quot;, *flag=&quot;force&quot;
output ruleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p>This backs up the provided collection daily at midnight. You can test
this delay rule has been executed by replacing it with
'&lt;ET&gt;00:00&lt;/ET&gt;&lt;PLUSET&gt;1m&lt;/PLUSET&gt;' and calling <code>ils -l</code> to
see the timestamp changing.</p>
<p>The following example syncs between 2 collections in 10 seconds from now
and repeats it hourly, forever:</p>
<pre><code>syncRule{
    delay(&quot;&lt;PLUSET&gt;10s&lt;/PLUSET&gt;&lt;EF&gt;1h&lt;/EF&gt;&quot;){
            msiCollRsync(*srcColl,*destColl,*resource,&quot;IRODS_TO_IRODS&quot;,*Status);
            writeLine(&quot;stdout&quot;,&quot;Synchronized collection *srcColl with collection *destColl&quot;);
    }
}

input *srcColl=&quot;/$rodsZoneClient/home/$userNameClient/newCollection&quot;, *destColl=&quot;/$rodsZoneClient/home/$userNameClient/newCollection_sync&quot;,*resource=&quot;default&quot;
output RuleExecOut
</code></pre>
<p>There are three useful iCommands to track the active delayed rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>iqstat</code>: show the queue status of delayed rules, and note the id</li>
<li><code>iqmod</code>: modify certain values in existing delayed rules (owned by
you)</li>
<li><code>iqdel</code>: remove a delayed rule (owned by you) from the queue, by
giving the id</li>
</ul>

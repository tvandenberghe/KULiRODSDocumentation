<h1>WebDAV Client Access (Davrods) {#webdav_access_to_irods}</h1>
<p>WebDAV stands for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, which is an
extension to HTTP, the protocol that web browsers and web servers use to
communicate with each other. WebDAV can be used for remotely managing
files over the internet. With WebDAV, we can access files stored in the
VSC Tier-1 Data component by using the same interface as we do with our
local files.</p>
<p>The module that we use for our iRODS connection is called
<a href="https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/davrods">Davrods</a>. Davrods is an
Apache WebDAV interface to iRODS and it provides access to iRODS servers
using the WebDAV protocol. It is a bridge between the WebDAV protocol
and iRODS.</p>
<p>For an access using Graphical User Interface (GUI) clients to iRODS, we
can and will use different tools. However in this page we will see how
to use mapping a network drive.</p>
<p>From a web browser side a simple directory index is used as an
interface. Its purpose is only to list and to view. It is not intended
to download and upload data.</p>
<h2>Web Browser-Directory Index</h2>
<p>A connection through Davrods is available at
<a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/</a> address. After you click the link
you can login using your vsc-account and a password, which should be
obtained at <a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be/">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be/</a>. To get the password you
simply log in the mentioned address by passing VSC authentication layer.</p>
<p>Therefore the first step is to acquire password. To do so, simply click
the link provided above or copy it and then &quot;paste and search for&quot; on
your favorite web browser.</p>

<p>Once you reach the screen above, choose a login provider that is
relevant to you. On the coming page you will see a very long password
highlighted on the picture below. Copy this password correctly.</p>

<p>After that you should go to the log in link
<a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/</a> and see the screen below.</p>
<p><img src="webdav/davrods_access.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Once you enter your user name and the password you saved, you will see
the exact same directory structure as you see in your iRODS server.</p>

<p>You can now walk around directories and read the data object on your
browser.</p>

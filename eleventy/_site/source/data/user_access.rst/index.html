<h1>User Access to iRODS {#user_access}</h1>
<p>The Tier-1 Data Service at KU Leuven is currently in a pilot phase, so
access to the system is strictly by invitation. If you have a use case
that combines data and computing workflows and you are interested on
testing the Tier-1 Data service you can contact us to discuss a possible
collaboration by e-mail at the address: <a href="mailto:data@vscentrum.be">data@vscentrum.be</a></p>
<p>To be able to log on and to use the Tier-1 Data platform, you need to
have an active vsc-account and an approved Tier-1 Data project. During
the pilot phase Tier-1 Data projects are granted by invitation only.</p>
<p>Users can connect to the iRODS platform by using different clients
(command line, WebDAV interface or web application) both from the VSC
HPC systems (login and compute nodes) and from external systems (i.e:
user's laptops).</p>
<p>Before you can interact with iRODS, as a VSC user you will need to
activate the service executing one of the following commands;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are logged in to the login nodes of Tier-1 or Tier-2 clusters
of KU Leuven, you should use:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-{=html}">&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ irods-setup | bash
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If you want to connect from any login nodes of other universities'
HPC cluster, you should execute:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-{=html}">&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ ssh login.hpc.kuleuven.be irods-setup | bash
</code></pre>
<p>In any case, any attempt to login to the Tier-1 or Tier-2 HPC clusters
at KU Leuven will invite you to open the HPC Firewall url, which in turn
forwards to your institutional login page. Therefore, please note that
you can't login to iRODS in an automated fashion. More information can
be found on the <a href="https://firewall.vscentrum.be/">HPC Firewall page</a>.</p>
<p>These commands will activate a temporary token for a period of 7 days.
After the 7 days have passed you will need to reactivate your access by
re-executing one of these commands again.</p>
<p>The Tier-1 Data service has the following landing page:
<a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be/">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be/</a>. This provides the entrypoint to start
working with iCommands, the Python iRODS client and the WebDAV client.</p>
<p>It is also possible to launch iCommands directly from your local Linux
(either native or via a VM or the Windows Subsystem for Linux) computer
against the Tier-1 iRODS zone. For this you need to install iCommands
and execute the snippet under 'iCommands Client on Linux' from the
landing page.</p>
<p>Once logged in iRODS users will have access to the following iRODS
collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your personal area: /kuleuven_tier1_pilot/home/vscXXXXX (where XXXXX
is the number of your vsc-account). This area is by default only
visible by your user account.</li>
<li>Your group area: /kuleuven_tier1_pilot/home/lt1_projectcode. The
area is shared and visible by all the members of your group.</li>
<li>The public area: /kuleuven_tier1_pilot/home/public. This is an area
accessible by everyone in the system. It could be even accessed by
anonymous users from external sources if this is configured. Usage
of this area is discouraged, and your group directory under home
should be used for shared storage.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Data Discovery</h1>
<p>iRODS allows users and administrators to access and contribute
descriptive information about their data (metadata). This metadata
improves the search experience and therefore enables data discovery.
Users can search for data objects using any metadata descriptor as
search terms. Both automatic, system-generated metadata and user-created
metadata are supported in iRODS.</p>
<h2>What is metadata?</h2>
<p>Metadata is often called data about data. It describes the data in some
way, such as providing information about the content, context of its
origin or use, quality, condition, and associations to other data and
objects. Metadata can describe a collection, a file or a component of
file. Metadata can be embedded in a data object, or stored in a database
and linked to the object it describes. Metadata is used to facilitate
data discovery to improve search and retrieval.</p>
<p>Scholars classify metadata into three categories: descriptive,
structural, and administrative. Descriptive metadata is intended to
support data discovery and identification. Title, abstract and keywords
are some example to descriptive metadata. Structural metadata describes
the structure of the data object. For example, title page, chapters, how
pages are ordered, number of pages, etc. Administrative metadata is
intended to facilitate management and processing of the data.
Identifying how the data was created, its file type, resolution,
copyright information, licensing information, access privileges are some
administrative metadata examples.</p>
<h2>Why metadata?</h2>
<p>Metadata serves a variety of purposes, with resource discovery one of
the most common. Here, it can be compared to effective cataloging, which
includes identifying resources, defining them by criteria, bringing
similar resources together and distinguishing among those that are
dissimilar. It is also a means of facilitating interoperability and
integrating resources. Using metadata to describe resources enables its
understanding by humans as well as machines. In addition to supporting
data discovery, metadata also organizes and provides contextual and
historical information about data objects, identifies structural
relationships within and between data objects.</p>

<h1>Cadaver Client Access</h1>
<p>Cadaver is a command-line client for WebDAV and is available on
UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux (native and Windows WSL) and
MacOS. It supports file upload, download, on-screen display, namespace
operations (move/copy), collection creation and deletion, and locking
operations. After connecting to a WebDAV endpoint a session opens.</p>
<p>As WebDAV is an extension on HTTP, a WebDAV server supports the basic
HTTP request methods such as GET, PUT and DELETE. WebDAV extends these
i.a. with MKCOL, MOVE and COPY. It is therefore possible to use cURL to
do file and collection operations. Please note Cadaver is more user
friendly and wraps all these operations in a Unix-like session.</p>
<h2>Using cURL with iRODS</h2>
<p>To use cURL (and cadaver), first go to <a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be</a>
and note your user account, temporary (4h) password and the Davrods
client url (<a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443</a>).</p>
<p>Before continuing with cURL (not cadaver) you should install the SSL
certificate provided by <a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443</a>. In most
browsers certificates can be downloaded by clicking the lock icon next
to the url bar and following through to the certificate. On Chrome and
Edge on Windows this opens a standard certificate viewer offering a .cer
file, on Firefox it's a .pem file. For further instructions converting
and installing certificates on Ubuntu, please follow the instructions at
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/security-trust-store">https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/security-trust-store</a>. You can skip
installing the certificate by providing the -k switch to curl; however
this is insecure as it bypasses SSL security. As it is better to use
cadaver we only show the most basic capabilities.</p>
<p>To show an overview of your collections, you can use the following
command. It only displays an html response.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/home/vscXXXXX/ --user vscXXXXX:password
</code></pre>
<p>To create a new Collection 'collection1':</p>
<pre><code>$ curl https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/home/vscXXXXX/ --user vscXXXXX:password -X MKCOL 'https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/home/vscXXXXX/collection1/'
</code></pre>
<p>To upload a file to your 'collection1' Collection:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/home/vscXXXXX/collection1/ --user vscXXXXX:password -T test.txt
</code></pre>
<h2>Using cadaver with iRODS</h2>
<p>Installation on Debian/Ubuntu is as follows: :</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cadaver
</code></pre>
<p>To use cadaver, first go to <a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be</a> and note
your user account, temporary (4h) password and the Davrods client url
(<a href="https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443">https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443</a>).</p>
<p>Start a cadaver session by executing <code>cadaver</code>. You can also connect to
your iRODS root collection in one command as follows:</p>
<pre><code>cadaver https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443/home/vscXXXXX
</code></pre>
<p><img src="cadaver/cadaver_access.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>If not yet the case, connect to the Tier 1 zone by executing:</p>
<pre><code>dav:!&gt; open https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443
</code></pre>
<p>The first time you connect, it will warn you with 'Untrusted server
certificate presented for irods.hpc.kuleuven.be' and then prompt you to
install the certificate. Proceed.</p>
<p>Then complete your username and password. You are now connected and can
perform the WebDAV operations.</p>
<p>Type <code>help</code> to discover all commands.</p>
<p>To create a Collection, you can use either <code>mkcol</code> or <code>mkdir</code>:</p>
<pre><code>dav:!&gt; mkcol cadaver_test
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can upload data objects to this new collection by first
specifying the local absolute path to the file, and then the remote
relative or absolute path:</p>
<pre><code>dav:!&gt; put /home/user/test.txt /home/vscXXXXX/cadaver_test
</code></pre>
<p>To leave the session and close cadaver, type <code>exit</code>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to run cadaver as a oneliner from the shell by
providing it a list of instructions.</p>
<p>Make a ~/davscript file with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>put /home/user/test.txt /home/vscXXXXX/cadaver_test
exit
</code></pre>
<p>You can also provide the client address next to an <code>open</code> command inside
the script.</p>
<p>Now you can execute these commands on the fly:</p>
<pre><code>$ cadaver -r ~/davscript https://irods.hpc.kuleuven.be:8443
</code></pre>

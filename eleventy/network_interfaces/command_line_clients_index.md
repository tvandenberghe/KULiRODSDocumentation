# Command line Access

It\'s possible to access an iRODS Zone via command line software that
support the WebDAV protocol. WebDAV stands for Web Distributed Authoring
and Versioning, which is an extension to HTTP, the protocol that web
browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. WebDAV can
be used for remotely managing files over the internet. With WebDAV, we
can access files stored in the VSC Tier-1 Data component by using the
same interface as we do with our local files.

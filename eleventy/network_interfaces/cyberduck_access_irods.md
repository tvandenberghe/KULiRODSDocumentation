## Upload from your local computer to iRODS

Warning
:::

When uploading your data to iRODS you should not upload files/folders
with names containing spaces (e.g. test1 for iRODS.txt) or name that
contain special characters (e.g. \~ \` ! @ \# \$ % \^ & \* ( ) + = { }
\[ \] \| : ; " ' \< \> , ? /). The command line side will/may typically
not tolerate these characters. For long file/folder names the use of
underscores (e.g. test1_for_iRODS.txt) is the recommended practice.

Cyberduck logs in automatically if there is only one bookmark. You don't
have to do the above two steps unless your password has not expired or
you have not deleted your "irods.hpc.kuleuven.be -- IRODS" bookmark. If
you have more than one bookmark, open the Cyberduck application and
double-click the "irods.hpc.kuleuven.be -- IRODS" bookmark.

To upload data from your local machine to iRODS, you can select file(s)
or folder(s) from your local machine\'s File Explorer or Finder and drag
them into the Cyberduck window to the destination folder/collection. You
can also create a new folder under File\>New Folder. Or you can click
the \'Upload\' button on the ribbon and select one or more files to the
current directory.

## Download from iRODS to local computer using Cyberduck

You can download from iRODS to your local machine similar to data
upload: select the data object(s)/collection(s) from the Cyberduck
window and drag them to a location on your local computer.

A 'Transfers' window will appear that can be used to monitor the
download to completion. You can also do "synchronization" which means it
will check both sides and will update your local folder that you can
create/choose based on the data in iRODS.
